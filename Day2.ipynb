    "When would you use a static method instead of a regular method?\n",
    "Static methods are useful when you need to perform operations related to a class but don't require access to instance-specific or class-specific data. They are ideal for utility functions or helper methods that logically belong to a class but operate independently of instance or class state. Using static methods helps in organizing related functions within a class without needing to instantiate objects."

    "ou defined a class attribute (color) for the Car class. Why can't you directly change the color of a specific car object (e.g., car1.color = \"blue\")? How would you achieve this? Class attribute in Python, it belongs to the class itself rather than any specific instance (object) of that class. the attribute is shared among all instances of the class. A class attribute is defined within the class but outside any methods. It is accessible using the class name (e.g., Car.color) and is shared by all instances of the class. To change the color directly we can use Instance attributes, which are specific to each object created from the class. They are defined within the constructor (init) and can vary from instance to instance."
